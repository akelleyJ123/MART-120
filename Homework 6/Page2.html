		<h1>Story</h1>
		<h3>This is a very short story that I wrote for a 53 word story contest a long time ago</h3>
		<p1>The dim orange of the setting sun slowly gives way to the light gray of dusk. <br>
		Trees sway in the gentle breeze of a warm summer night.<br>
		As the sun dips below the horizon, the summertime serenity is quickly <br>
		interrupted by the mournful cry of whatever creatures of shadow lurk within the trees.

		<h1>Some favorite Pictures</h1>
		<h3>These are some of my favorite pictures from a photography class a few<br>
		semesters ago</h3>
