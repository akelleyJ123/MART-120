	GUI(Graphical User Interface) refers to the way your computer organizes files, folders, etc, for easy everyday access.
The file explorer for windows or the finder (I think this is right) on Mac are examples of GUI. They organize files on our computers in an easy to 
use format that virtually anyone could use. 

	CLI(Command Line Interface) on the other hand, is a bit more complicated. The CLI refers to a way of organizing files, folders, etc. just like the 
GUI, but it isn't nearly as visual and relies on text prompts(commands) that allow you to access and search for files or folders very quickly though
the visual element isn't present. The CLI allows you to quickly access everything on your computer if you know how to use it.
